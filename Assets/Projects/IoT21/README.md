### Problem Statement<br>
Agriculture faces challenges in achieving efficient crop growth while minimizing environmental harm due to inefficient fertilizer application methods. Overuse or underuse of nutrients harms soil health, reduces yields, and increases costs, while excessive runoff leads to water pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. The absence of precise, real-time monitoring and automated solutions exacerbates nutrient imbalances, failing to account for diverse soil conditions and crop requirements. An IoT-Based Automated Fertilizer Dispensing System can address these issues by leveraging smart sensors to monitor soil conditions and automate precise fertilizer delivery, optimizing resource use and promoting sustainable farming practices.

### Proposed Solution 
  
The proposed solution involves the system will use an NPK sensor to monitor soil nutrient levels (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium) and a capacitive soil moisture sensor to assess water content. Based on the sensor readings, the system will refer to a predefined table to determine the type and ratio of fertilizers required. The selected fertilizer solution will then be distributed through a drip irrigation system. Data collection and irrigation/fertilizer dispensing will occur at regular intervals, controlled by a Raspberry Pi.
