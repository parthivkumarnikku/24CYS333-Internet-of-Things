### Problem Statement
Urban transportation faces significant challenges, including congestion, environmental concerns, and inefficient bike sharing systems. Traditional
bike-sharing setups often lack smart features like seamless payment, real-time tracking, and maintenance alerts, limiting their appeal and usability. In addition, users often face problems such as unclear vehicle availability, lack of range estimation, and difficulty ensuring bike security.<br> 
This project aims to design and implement a prototype Smart Bike Sharing System that integrates Internet of Things (IoT) technology to address these challenges. The system focuses on two key functionalities: payment-based unlocking and dynamic range display.<br> 
A GPS module will enable real-time tracking, allowing users and administrators to monitor the bike’s location for safety and efficient management.

### Literature Survey  

#### Existing Solutions  
Current systems addressing secure bike-sharing, tracking, and theft prevention include:  
- **IoT-Based Bike Sharing Systems:** In this type of system, IoT devices are used for unlocking bikes and tracking usage. However, such systems often do not include sophisticated theft detection mechanisms like accelerometer-based monitoring and real-time geofencing.  
- **GPS-Enabled Fleet Management:** The use of GPS tracking is common in shared mobility solutions to track the location of vehicles. Though effective for tracking, the existing implementations are not fully integrated with theft detection or remote locking features, thus making them vulnerable.
 
- **Payment-Integrated Mobility Models:** Pay-and-Go bike rentals, for example, make the payment process very streamlined but do not have mechanisms to integrate payment confirmation with secure unlocking, thus allowing unauthorized use or bypass.  

#### Research Gaps  
- **Integrated Theft Detection and Prevention:** Although the present systems are not perfect, theft prevention models that use a combination of accelerometers and geofencing to predict unauthorized movement are not available at present.
- **Real-Time Tracking and Alerts:** Existing solutions inadequately use IoT and GPS for immediate alerts, live status updates and remote control, hindering effective fleet and security management.
