### Problem statement

Traditional power grids lack real-time optimization, leading to over-reliance on fossil fuels even when renewable energy is available.Current grids struggle to integrate renewable sources efficiently, resulting in underutilization and increased carbon emissions.There is no autonomous system to prioritize renewable energy over fossil fuels based on real-time demand and supply.Grids lack real-time monitoring tools, delaying fault detection and reducing overall efficiency.Reactive maintenance and operational inefficiencies increase costs and lead to longer downtimes during outages.

### Literature Survey  

#### Existing Solutions  
- **Self-Healing and High-Reliability Distribution Systems:** The use of advanced metering, automation, and communication networks to enable self-healing capabilities and high reliability. However, these systems face challenges in ensuring real-time adaptability and seamless integration of distributed energy resources (DER).
- **Renewable Integration and Grid Automation Frameworks:** Integrating renewable energy and enhancing grid automation. While these frameworks improve load balancing and peak demand management, they often lack comprehensive solutions for addressing cybersecurity threats and ensuring grid stability in real-time.  

#### Research Gaps  
1. **Interoperability and Cybersecurity:** Despite advancements in grid automation and communication technologies, robust frameworks for ensuring interoperability and cybersecurity across diverse smart grid components remain underdeveloped. 
2. **Real-Time Adaptability:** Current smart grid designs often lack mechanisms for real-time adaptability to sudden changes in demand, renewable energy supply fluctuations, and grid disruptions, limiting their efficiency and resilience.
