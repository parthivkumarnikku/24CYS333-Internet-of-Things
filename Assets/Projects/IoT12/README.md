### Problem Statement:

Borewell pumps are critical for providing water in agriculture, industrial, and domestic sectors especially in remote areas. However, monitoring and controlling these pumps manually is challenging, time-consuming and inefficient. Problems such as pump failures, energy wastage, water overuse and delayed detection of issues lead to increased costs, resource wastage and operational inefficiencies. Current systems lack real-time remote monitoring and automated control capabilities leaving users unable to respond quickly to malfunctions or optimize pump operations.

### Proposed solution:

The proposed system addresses the challenges of manual monitoring and control of borewell pumps by providing an IoT-based solution for real-time monitoring, automated control, and operational efficiency.

**Core Functionalities:**
- **Continuous Monitoring:**
  - Real-time tracking of water levels in borewell and overhead tanks.
  - Monitoring pump status, energy consumption, and performance metrics.
   
- **Cloud Integration:**
  - Sensor data is uploaded to an AWS cloud platform for remote access, visualization, and analysis.
  - Historical data logs enable better decision-making and resource optimization.

- **Proactive Alerts:**
  - Real-time alerts for critical conditions like dry running, overflow, or pump failures via SMS, email, or push notifications.

- **Automated and Remote Control:**
  - Automated pump operation based on water level thresholds.
  - Remote ON/OFF control via a mobile app or web interface for flexibility.

- **User-Friendly Interface:**
  - Intuitive web/mobile application for both technical and non-technical users to monitor and control the system effectively.

This solution improves efficiency, reduces resource wastage, and enhances the reliability of borewell pump operations, especially in remote areas.

#### Use cases:

- Optimize agricultural and domestic water management by enabling real-time
 monitoring and automation of borewell pumps.
- Residential Water Supply: Smart home integration for automatic borewell pump
 operation based on water demand.
- Industrial Applications: Remote monitoring of borewell pumps used in
 manufacturing and power plants.

### Literature survey:

- Both studies illustrate the potential of IoT in improving borewell management.
While Malche and Maheshwary (2017) focus on water level monitoring for
agricultural applications, Ramu et al. (2020) extend the scope to autonomous
borewell management, emphasizing energy conservation. Future research can
integrate AI-driven predictive analytics to optimize water consumption patterns and
enhance system efficiency.
- Prasad et al. (2017) proposed a system using ultrasonic sensors to monitor ground
water levels and alert users through mobile notifications.
- Gurguiatu et al. (2013) focused on energy savings by implementing active power
filters in water pump systems to enhance efficiency.
- LoRa and Zigbee: Implemented in large-scale agricultural lands for low-power,
long-range communication
- Integration of real-time alerts for critical conditions (dry running, leaks, and
overflow). The system provides automated notifications via a web or
mobile interface

### Deliverables:
- Web/Mobile Dashboard: Allows users to monitor the status of water level and availability in real time and analyze past readings.
