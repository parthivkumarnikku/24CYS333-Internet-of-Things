### Problem Statement
 Ensuring the safety and quality of water is critical for public health and environmental sustainability. Traditional water testing methods are slow and lack real-time insights, making it difficult to address contamination promptly.

 This project aims to develop an IoT-based solution for real-time monitoring and analysis of water quality in diverse contexts, including drinking water supplies, household water systems, public water tanks, and agricultural water sources.

 By leveraging advanced sensors, data analytics, and cloud connectivity, the system will track parameters such as pH, turbidity, and contaminant levels, providing instant alerts on water quality issues. This enables proactive interventions to ensure safety, improve resource management, and maintain compliance with health and environmental standards across various applications.

 ### Literature Survey
 Existing IoT-based water quality monitoring systems typically focus on basic parameters like pH and TDS, using microcontrollers such as Arduino or ESP32 for real-time data transmission and platforms like ThingSpeak for visualization. However, they lack advanced analytics, monitor limited parameters, face scalability and energy efficiency challenges, and often neglect IoT security. Our project addresses these gaps by integrating predictive analytics to provide early warnings for contamination, expanding monitoring to include microbial content, heavy metals, and agricultural contaminants like nitrates and phosphates. Additionally, we aim to design scalable, energy-efficient solutions, such as solar-powered systems, suitable for diverse applications like drinking water, household systems, public water tanks, and agriculture. Robust IoT security measures will also ensure secure data transmission.

 ### Proposed Solution
- The proposed system utilizes IoT-enabled sensors to continuously monitor pH levels
and contaminant concentrations in real time.
- The collected data is transmitted to a cloud platform for analysis, where AI-driven
algorithms identify anomalies and provide actionable insights.
- Users receive instant alerts via a mobile app or dashboard, allowing for timely
interventions. This solution ensures efficient water quality management, promotes
public health safety, and meets regulatory compliance.

#### Use Case
1. Household Drinking Water Safety Homeowners install the system in residential water
 storage tanks to monitor water quality before consumption. The system sends alerts
 via a mobile app if contamination levels rise, prompting users to filter or replace the
 water. Helps maintain safe and clean drinking water at the household level,
 especially in areas with inconsistent water quality.
2. Water Treatment Plant Monitoring Water purification plants use the system to
 continuously monitor pH, TDS, and turbidity levels. If parameters exceed safe limits,
 the system triggers alerts for immediate corrective action (e.g., adjusting filtration or
 chemical treatment). Ensures compliance with government water quality standards
 (e.g., WHO, BIS).
3. Public Water Supply System Monitoring Municipal corporations install the system in
 public water tanks to monitor real-time water quality. If contamination or parameter
 deviations (e.g., high turbidity) are detected, the system alerts authorities to take
 action before distribution. Prevents the supply of unsafe drinking water to
 households and communities.
