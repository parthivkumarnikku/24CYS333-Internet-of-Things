### Problem Statement

Blood banks face inefficiencies in inventory management, proper storage, and timely distribution, leading to wastage and shortages. The lack of real-time monitoring for blood stock, storage conditions, and immediate communication between donors, blood banks, and recipients further exacerbates the problem. An IoT-enabled system can address these challenges by enabling real-time data collection, inventory tracking, and seamless communication.

### Literature Survey

#### *Existing Solutions*  
1. *Traditional Inventory Systems:*  
   - Manual and database-driven inventory management in blood banks.  
   - *Limitations:* Lack of real-time tracking and automated updates.  

2. *IoT-Enhanced Solutions:*  
   - Temperature monitoring systems for storage.  
   - *Limitations:* Does not integrate with inventory or provide end-to-end communication.  

3. *Mobile Apps for Donor Coordination:*  
   - Platforms like erakthgosh are available.  
   - *Limitations:* These solutions have limited adoption and are used in only a few regions.  

#### *Research Gaps*  
1. *Real-Time Integration:* Lack of systems integrating IoT for dynamic inventory management and anomaly detection.  
2. *Donor-Recipient Communication:* Minimal focus on automated notifications to bridge gaps between donors and recipients.  
3. *Emergency Response Management:* Absence of mechanisms to reserve blood dynamically during emergencies.  

------------------------------

### Proposed Solution  

#### *Relevance of Proposed Work*  

1. *Smart Storage and Monitoring:*  
   - IoT sensors track temperature and stock quantity in real-time, ensuring blood safety.  
   - Interfaces tailored for hospitals, blood banks, and the public simplify operations and decision-making.  

2. *Enhanced Transparency and Trust:*  
   - Barcode systems ensure accurate inventory logs and verify blood packet integrity.  

3. *Improved Communication:*  
   - Automated notifications to donors during shortages and to recipients for request updates foster timely action.  

4. *Recognition-Based Rewards:*  
   - A donor reward system incentivizes regular donations through recognition and token-based benefits.  

5. *Emergency Reserve Mechanism:*  
   - Real-time inventory allows dynamic blood reservation for nearby ambulances during emergencies.

#### *Use cases*

1. *Fraud Prevention & Regulatory Compliance:* ✅
   - The barcode system prevents black-market blood sales by ensuring that only authorized hospitals and patients receive blood.
   - The government health database (e.g., National Blood Transfusion Council NBTC) receives automated reports, improving transparency and compliance with 
      health regulations.
      
 2. *Accident and Emergency Response:* ✅
    - A road accident victim in a Tier-2 city needs AB-negative blood. The hospital checks stock via IoT; if unavailable, donors are alerted. A donor responds,
      blood is tested using the doctor’s utility, and sent to the hospital in time, ensuring faster access to rare blood groups.
      
 3. *Blood Donation & Medical Camps:* ✅
    - IoT-enabled QR codes register donor and volunteer participation, while blockchain ensures tamper-proof records. NFT rewards for frequent contributors 
      incentivize sustained engagement in medical aid initiatives.
