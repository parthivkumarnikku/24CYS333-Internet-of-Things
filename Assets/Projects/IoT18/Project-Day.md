# Project Day

![Date](https://img.shields.io/badge/Date-March_7,_2025-blue)

## Modules:
1. **Connection Establishment**
2. **Servers & Communication Establishment**
3. **Static IP Address Allocation for All Devices**
4. **Network Intrusion Detection System Establishment**

## Completed:

### Completed Module 1 - Connection Establishment âœ…:
- Configured Raspberry Pi as an access point and router.
- Established connection between all devices.
- All devices successfully connect to the virtual access point of the Raspberry Pi and access the network.

### Completed Module 2 - Servers & Communication Establishment âœ…:
- Set up an **MQTT server** for data transmission from the Arduino board.
- Established a **dashboard** for mobile phone access.

### Completed Module 3 - Static IP Address Allocation âœ…:
- Allocated static IP addresses for all devices in the network.

## Objectives For The Day:
- **Implementation of a Honeypot**
- **Proceed with security configurations**
- **Firewall & IDS configurations**
- Configure **PSAD** to flag attacker IPs and redirect all traffic from flagged IPs to the honeypot.
- Mitigate **MAC spoofing risks** due to static IP allocation.
- Perform **network security testing** to ensure no compromise.
- **Secure the MQTT protocol** `Applied Cryptography`.


### Next Steps:
- Strengthen network security through **firewall rules**.
- Test and validate **intrusion detection** mechanisms.
- Enhance **authentication and encryption** for MQTT communications. `Applied Crypto`

ðŸ“Œ **Status:** _Work in Progress_
